### Refactoring Fortune Teller with Dynamic Routes

If we set up a route like this (for now let’s send it to the existing two_six action):

get("/roll/:zebra/:giraffe", { :controller => "dice", :action => "two_six" })
and then try visiting /roll/42/513 again, the route does match, and you get sent to the old action for two six-sided dice. What happens if you change the route to:

get("/roll/zebra/giraffe", { :controller => "dice", :action => "two_six" })
(removing the colons before zebra and giraffe) and visit /roll/42/513 again? “No route matches.” Ok, put the colons back:

get("/roll/:zebra/:giraffe", { :controller => "dice", :action => "two_six" })
So, by beginning a segment of a path with a colon, we’re making it dynamic. Rails will, for the purpose of routing, allow anything there; it’s like a wildcard.

Now, watch your server log while visiting the URL:
