## Time 1000 RCAV: Route

- config/routes.rb: contains all of our routes
- example route:
    - self.get("/rock", {controller => "application", :action => "play_rock"})
- .get: expects a string as its first argument, containing the path that we assing to let users visit
- it expects a hash as its second argurment, where we tell it which method ot executes when someone visits the path

* when building out websites, buld the site name first then flush it out

** Workflow **
 - define a route
 - make an action
 - render the template

** images and css in the public folder **
