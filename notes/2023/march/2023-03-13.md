# Codecademy notes
- unless: uses control flow to check if something is false, rather than if it's true. 
    ex: ```hungry = false```
        ``` puts "I'm writing ruby programs!"```
        ``` puts "Time to eat ```

- equal or not (==): comparator means "is equal to"
    ex: ``` x = 2 ```
        ``` y = 2 ```
        ``` if x ==y ```
        ``` print "x and y are equal!"
        ``` end ```

- Less than or Greater than: check to see if one value is less than, less than or equal to, greater than, or greater than or equal to another.
    - less than: <
    - less than or equal to: <=
    - greter than: >
    - grater than or equal to: >=

-  Or operator (||): 
    - true || true  # true
    - true || false # true
    - false || true # true
    - false || false # false

- gsub! (global substution)
  - ex: string_to_change.gusb!(/s/, "th")

- while loop:
  - ``` counter = 1 ```
  - ``` while counter < 11 ```
  - ``` puts counter ```
  - ``` counter = counter + 1 ```
  - ``` end ```
  - ``` 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 ```

- until loop
  - ``` i = 0 ```
  - ``` unitl i == 6 ```
  - ``` i = i + 1 ```
  - ``` end ```
  - ``` puts ``

- for loop:
  - ``` for num in 1...10 ```
    ``` puts num ```
    ``` end ```

- Inclusive and Exclusive ranges
  - 1...10 = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9
  - 1..10 = 1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10
  
- break: breaks a loop as soon as its condition is met.

- next: can be used to skip over certain steps in the loop. ex: if you do not want ot print out the even numbers.
    - ``` for i in 1..5 ```
    - ``` next if i % 2 == 0 ```
    - ``` print i ```
    - ``` end ```

- .each: loop iteraotor, that applies an expression to each element of an object, one at a time.
    - ``` object.each { |item| #do something} ```
    - ``` object.each do |item|  ```
    - ``` # do something ```
    - ``` end ```
