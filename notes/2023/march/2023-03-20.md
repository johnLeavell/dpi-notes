###  if / else statments

- the basic anatomy of if statements

``` 
    if condition
    # code that runs if the condidion is true
    end
```

- mulitbranch if statements
```
    the_temp = rand(100)

    p the_temp

    if the_temp > 75
    p "its going to be a great day today"
    else
    p "Don't leave home today"
    end
```

- multiple conditions that get checked, one after the other:

```
    the_temp = rand(100)
    p the_temp

    if the_temp > 75
    p "its going to be a great day today"
    elseif the_them > 32
    p "itll be an okay day today"
    else
    p "Dont leave home today"
    end
```

- truthines and falsiness

```
    if true # Replace this with each expression.  Whih of them count as "truthy"?
    p "the expression is truthy"
    else
    p "the expression is falsy"
    end
```

- comparisons
    < <= => > == !=


- Equivalence va assignment

    == / = 

- Combining conditions with && and ||

``` 
p 3.odd? && 4.even?

p 3.odd? && 4.odd?

p 3.even? && 4.odd?
p 3.odd? || 4.even?
p 3.odd? || 4.odd?
```
