## Refactoring MSM 2


--using methods on class via associations
-- defining methods in our models that encapuslate logic and then its reuseable


-- association accessor method 
class Venue < ApplicationRecord
   
    def comments
        # take the id of the veunu
        my_id = self.id

        # go to the comments table, search in the foregin key column
        mathcing_comments = Comment.where({ :venue_id => my_id })
        
        # return it
        return matching_comments
    end

end



#####--------------------##################
The association access our method that we're going to put the  hild object, which helps  us easliy retireive the parent object. Will look like the below.

** this works for one-to-many associations

class Movie < ApplicationRecord

    def dirctor
        key = self.director_id

        matching_set = Director.where({ :id => key })

        the_one = matching_set.first

        return the_one
    end
end

class Character < ApplicationRecord
    
    def movie
        key  = self.movie_id

        matching_set = Movie.where({ :id => key })

        the_one = matching_set.first

        return the_one
    end
end

## refactored way to wirte the abouve method, only  if you have a one to many association 

    class Character < ApplicationRecord
        belongs_to(:movie, { :class_name => "Movie", :foreign_key => "movie_id" })
    :movie = name of the method
    {} = whats the class name of the associated table
     = what is  the foregin key column to use on this query?

## another refactored way to write the association method.
     belongs_to(:movie)

     class Movie
        has_many(:characters)
        belongs_to(:director)

### ActiveRecord scoped associations
